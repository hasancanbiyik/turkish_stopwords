# Turkish Stopwords List

This repo contains a comprehensive list of Turkish stopwords, which are commonly used words in the Turkish language that are often excluded during natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These words typically carry little semantic meaning and include pronouns, conjunctions, prepositions, auxiliary verbs, and other frequently used terms.

## Features
- A comprehensive and deduplicated list of Turkish stopwords.
- This list contains *394 words* in total
- The list was built upon the work by [tkorkunckaya](https://github.com/tkorkunckaya/Turkish-Stopwords), with additional stopwords that were missing from the original list.
- Useful for NLP tasks such as text preprocessing, tokenization, and stopword removal.

## File
- **`tr_stopwords.txt`**: A text file containing the complete list of Turkish stopwords, with one stopword per line.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/turkish-stopwords.git
   ```
2. Use the `comprehensive_turkish_stopwords.txt` file in your NLP projects by loading it as a stopwords list in your preferred programming language.

## Acknowledgments
