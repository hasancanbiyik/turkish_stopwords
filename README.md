# Turkish Stopwords List

This repo contains a comprehensive list of Turkish stopwords, which are commonly used words in the Turkish language that are often excluded during natural language processing (NLP) tasks. 

Here is a brief description of "stopwords": Stopwords are the words in any language which does not add much meaning to a sentence. They can safely be ignored without sacrificing the meaning of the sentence. (More information here: https://shorturl.at/rScFr)

## Features
- A comprehensive and deduplicated list of Turkish stopwords.
- This list contains *395 words* in total
- The list was built upon the work by [tkorkunckaya](https://github.com/tkorkunckaya/Turkish-Stopwords), with additional stopwords that were missing from the original list.
- Useful for NLP tasks such as text preprocessing, tokenization, and stopword removal.

## File
- **`tr_stopwords.txt`**: The text file that contains the complete list of Turkish stopwords, with one stopword per line.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hasancanbiyik/turkish_stopwords.git
